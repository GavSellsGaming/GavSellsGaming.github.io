Hello, I'm Gav, I plan to sell alot of digital products on eBay.
Below is some of my products, what some of the terms I use mean, and more.

## Terminology

### Pokemon Go

- FLD: Full Login Details; you will recieve login information from purchasing. 

- T2FLD: Trade to Full Login Details; This may cost a bit more because I have to make a new account, level it and then trade the stuff to the account myself, then to give it to you. This is here incase you don't feel comfortable with the TRADE option.

- TRADE: You must provide me your location, preferably in coordinates, and I will add you as a friend and trade you. trading fees are not covered. Just give me whatever.

## Products

- Nothing here yet...

## Notice

I will be recording probably every transaction, delivery, and extra proof incase you try to scam, are sales are final, and you get what you see.
